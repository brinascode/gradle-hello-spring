GO to Root :
    --Windows: cd/
    --MAC: cd\

Make a directory:
    WIN: mkdir + dir_name
    MAC: mkdir + dir_name

To go inside the directory:
    WIN: cd + dir_name/location
    MAC: cd + dir_name/location


Listing files:
    MAC: ls, 
        ltrR (to get more details?)


df -h(human readable) -k(shows you in kilobytes) --> df is a standard Unix command used to display the amount of available disk space for file systems on which the invoking user has appropriate read access.


cat --> to read a file


top--> how much CPU you have
     -n 1 (I only want one instance, don't refresh)
      Examples:
        top -n 1 > info.txt (sending the data to a text file)
        cat info.txt

What's the difference between these two?? if tee is the one making it show on the screen what is the real difference?
./hi | tee (-> show me on the screen , go to the file. Two directions (like in a T)) hi.txt
./hi > hi.txt
    --> what does tee do?


history
     c   --> to clear ! 
     Ex:
        history | tail -10 -->  to only show the last 10 lines
ulimit -a 
    --maximum memory size is impt

CHMOD stuff
CHMOD vs CHOWN



vi my file
esc + i --> for insert
esc the shift + zz --> to save and close
What about to not save and leave?  


cd / --> to the drive

ls -ltr --> shows you file size in bytes, not bits
ls -ltr | grep -i test
ls -ltr | grep -i how
grep means to get it

Create --> touch
Delete --> rm
Open --> cat
Close --> 
Read->>cat
write --> vr
append --> echo "finished" >> hw1. cat hw1 >> hw2
cat hw2 >> hw1
cat hw2 >> hw1 
(be careful: cat hw2 > hw1 will overwrite hw1 .
>hw1  :it will totally make hw1 blank 
cp hw1 hw1.bak 
Comes handy in troubleshooting: 
Seek --> You seek information: cat hw1 | grep -i (means ignore the case. -in numbers the lines) hi      
Rename: mv hw1 hw9


Bin: has the executable files
etc: has services, like network information
lib: you need library to run languages like C, java, etc
usr: user information like home directories
tmp: for temporary files that you do not care to loose
