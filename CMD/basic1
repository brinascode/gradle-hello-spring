df -h(human readable) -k(shows you in kilobytes) --> df is a standard Unix command used to display the amount of available disk space for file systems on which the invoking user has appropriate read access.


cat --> to read a file


top--> how much CPU you have
     -n 1 (I only want one instance, don't refresh)
      Examples:
        top -n 1 > info.txt (sending the data to a text file)
        cat info.txt

What's the difference between these two?? if tee is the one making it show on the screen what is the real difference?
./hi | tee (-> show me on the screen , go to the file. Two directions (like in a T)) hi.txt
./hi > hi.txt
    --> what does tee do?


history
     c   --> to clear ! 
     Ex:
        history | tail -10 -->  to only show the last 10 lines
ulimit -a 
    --maximum memory size is impt
